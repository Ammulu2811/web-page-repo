        <p>India’s frontier, which is roughly one-third coastline, abuts six countries. 
            The land of India—together with Bangladesh and most of Pakistan—forms a well-defined 
            subcontinent, set off from the rest of Asia by the imposing northern mountain 
            rampart of the Himalayas and by adjoining mountain ranges to the west and east.
